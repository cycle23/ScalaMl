/**
  * Generic class that defines the operator of a trading signal.
  *
  * A trading signal is emitted once a value (or data point) in a time series reaches a
  * threshold (upward or downward movement).
  * {{{
  * A signal is triggers when x(n) > target value or x(n) < target value
  * }}}
  * The signal operator implements the '''Operator''' trait defined as an element of
  * a '''Gene''' in a genetic algorithm. The trading signal operators are None, >, < and ==.
  * @constructor Create an instance of an operator for a trading signal.
