/**
  * Define a trading signal as used in technical analysis of financial markets. A partial
  * list of trading signals, include volume, Flow index, momentum or oscillators. This class
  * inherit the '''Gene''' class so trading signals can be threaded into trading strategy
  * implemented as chromosomes of a genetic algorithm.
  *
  * A trading signal is emitted once a value (or data point) in a time series reaches a
  * threshold (upward or downward movement).
  * {{{
  * A signal is triggers when x(n) > target value or x(n) < target value
  * }}}
  * The class assume that a digitization function that discrete a continuous value is defined
  * implicitly.
  * @constructor Create a trading signal used for analyzing changes in variables derived from
  *              the price and trading volume of a security.
  * @param id Label or identifier for the trading signal
  * @param target Target value (or threshold) used to trigger the signal.
  * @param op Operator that is used to defined the condition such as greater than, equals....
  * @param xt  Times series of single variable the signal acts upon.
  * @param weights Weights applied to each value of the time series (optional).
  * @param quant Quantization function that convert analog or continuous signal to a
  *              discrete time series.
  *
  * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the class parameters are not properly defined.
  * @throws ImplicitNotFoundException if the Quantization function has not been defined.
